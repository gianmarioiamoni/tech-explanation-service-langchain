    "🧠 **Answer generated using your documents**\n\n📊 **Tokens used:** 569 (input: 3, output: 566)\n\nAI Knowledge Companion: \n\nAI Knowledge Companion is a modern, full-stack platform designed to create custom AI tutors by leveraging a variety of media types, including documents, audio, video, and images. This platform utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the learning experience by providing contextual responses based on the uploaded materials.\n\nKey Features: \n\n• Custom AI Tutors: Users can create an unlimited number of AI tutors, each tailored to specific subjects or learning styles. The configuration options allow for adjustments in personality, tone, and teaching style to suit different educational needs.\n\n• RAG-Based Responses: The platform employs RAG to generate contextual responses. When a user poses a question, the system generates an embedding for the query, performs a vector similarity search, retrieves relevant information, and constructs a context that is sent to the AI model for a comprehensive answer.\n\n• Intelligent Chat Interface: The platform features a real-time chat interface that enables users to interact with their AI tutors. It includes functionalities such as source citation, context tracking, and conversation history management, ensuring a seamless learning experience.\n\n• Multi-Language Support: The AI tutors can communicate in multiple languages, currently supporting English and Italian, making the platform accessible to a broader audience.\n\nMarketplace: \n\nThe AI Knowledge Companion includes a marketplace where users can share their custom AI tutors, allowing for collaboration and resource sharing within the community.\n\nTechnical Stack: \n\nThe platform is built using several modern technologies, including:\n\n• Next.js: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation for optimal performance.\n\n• TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, enhancing code quality and maintainability.\n\n• Supabase: A backend-as-a-service platform that provides a robust database and authentication services.\n\n• OpenAI: Utilized for its powerful GPT-4 model, which generates responses based on the context provided.\n\n• LangChain: A library that facilitates the implementation of RAG utilities.\n\n• Stripe: Integrated for payment processing, allowing users to monetize their AI tutors.\n\nMedia Processing: \n\nThe platform supports video processing with audio extraction from formats like MP4, MOV, AVI, and WebM. Additionally, it includes image OCR and analysis capabilities for formats such as JPG, PNG, GIF, and WebP.\n\nInstallation and Setup: \n\nTo get started with AI Knowledge Companion, users need to clone the repository, install dependencies using pnpm, set up Git hooks for security, and configure environment variables with their credentials.\n\nSupport and Community: \n\nUsers can seek support through GitHub Issues and Discussions, as well as access documentation for further guidance. The platform encourages community involvement and acknowledges contributions from various open-source tools and libraries.\n\nIn summary, AI Knowledge Companion is a versatile platform that empowers users to create personalized AI tutors, enhancing the educational experience through advanced technology and community collaboration.",
