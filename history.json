    "AI Knowledge Hub",
    "🧠 **Answer generated using your documents**\n\n📊 **Tokens used:** 401 (input: 3, output: 398)\n\nAI Knowledge Hub: \n\nThe AI Knowledge Hub is an advanced platform designed to enhance organizational efficiency by transforming company documentation into an AI-powered knowledge assistant. This platform utilizes a combination of technologies including Next.js 15, Supabase, LangChain, and OpenAI to deliver enterprise-grade multi-tenant capabilities.\n\nWhat It Does: \n\n• Document Ingestion: The platform allows users to upload documents, such as PDFs. It automatically extracts text from these documents, intelligently chunks the content, and vectorizes it using OpenAI embeddings. This process enables the AI to understand and retrieve relevant information effectively.\n\nArchitecture Overview: \n\n• The architecture of the AI Knowledge Hub is built around several key components. It includes internationalized routes for user interfaces, such as dashboards, document management, chat interfaces, and standard operating procedure (SOP) management.\n\n• The API section provides endpoints for chat queries, subscription events, and scheduled jobs, facilitating seamless interactions and functionalities.\n\n• The components directory contains various UI elements tailored for admin tasks, chat functionalities, dashboards, and document management, ensuring a cohesive user experience.\n\n• The library section includes server-only utilities that handle tasks such as vector search, prompt engineering, user management, and rate limiting, which are essential for maintaining performance and security.\n\nAI Models Selection Rationale: \n\n• The platform employs specific AI models based on use cases. For embeddings, it uses a cost-effective model that balances speed and performance. For chat functionalities, a more economical version of GPT-4 is utilized, which is suitable for factual question-and-answer scenarios. For SOP generation, a more complex model is chosen to handle structured outputs effectively.\n\nPerformance Optimizations: \n\n• The AI Knowledge Hub plans to implement caching strategies, particularly for frequently queried embeddings. This will enhance performance by reducing the time taken to retrieve commonly accessed data.\n\nIn summary, the AI Knowledge Hub is a robust solution for organizations looking to leverage their documentation through AI, providing tools for efficient information retrieval, SOP generation, and team management.",
